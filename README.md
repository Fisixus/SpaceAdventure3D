# Space Adventure 3D
Year 2987, Spaceman try to map a new planetary system with his spaceship. In this system, whole of the planets have a circle and they all have different colors.

### Dependencies
This program has been generated by retained mode (post 3.0) OpenGL. Program has been written with shaders(_**glsl**_) in modern OpenGL. Program should run in win32 environment and needs glut and opengl libraries.

### Elements

Spaceship: Drawn as a union of two tori (plural of torus).

Planets: Drawn as colorful spheres with white circles.

Space Station: Drawn as a grey sphere.

Compass: Drawn as a tetrahedron.

### World Coordinates
The ground lies along the x-z plane and the y axis points up. So in the beginning ship's velocity vector set to (0.0, 0.0, -1.0).

### View Modes
**View Mode 1**

If you press '**c**',  the camera will set up to front of the spaceship and you can find your direction by looking up the tetrahedrons's(Compass) direction.

**View Mode 2**

If you press '**s**', the camera will set up to front of the space station, so you can see the planetary system by the space station's front(pink square).

**View Mode 3**

If you press '**t**', the camera will set up to slightly up and back of the spaceship, so you can see space as well as the ship.

**View Mode 4**

If you press '**w**', the camera will set up to LARGE_Y position, so you can see the whole planet system, spaceship and space station by top view.
